# boot-test
Keep a tract of my learing spring boot.

Spring boot is so cool. It provides a effiecient way to build a java project. 
No matter what kind of component you need, such as spring data, datasource, tomcat or restful service,
you just put some configs in your application.propeties, everythins is done.
